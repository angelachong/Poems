I got off the wrong stop again last night. 
except this time there were no photos to take during the walk.

Ever since you left 
I've put an extra pump of sugar in my coffee.

Maybe I’m not sweet enough
or maybe I never was.

Everything tastes bitter
like the double espresso you enjoy so much.

I drink my whiskey with a shot of coke to make it go down smoother.
But there was nothing smooth about you

You were textured skin and stolen glances.
Silver lashes dusting warm cheeks 
and I was a silent storm collapsing internally.

How can I begin again
when every step I take 
knocks me 10 steps back?

You thought I was a good kisser
and I thought you were my Halley’s Comet.

but I shouldn't wait for you.
even though I want to

I want to

I want to

I want to…
