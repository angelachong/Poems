will you see her tonight
this night is THE night
will you unwrap her like a gift
like a present you've opened every year
patiently waiting for your return

will she keep you warm tonight
like i kept you warm those cold winter nights

will I cross your mind as you go to her
do you long for her
as I long for you

will you give yourself to her
after what she did to you those hot summer nights.

will you unwrap yourself
like a gift to her 
this night is THE night..
will you open yourself like you have every year.
as I patiently wait for your return.
