Maybe I should start being an introvert from now on. 
No more speaking out. 
No more asking to know something or someone. 
No more trying.

Maybe being an open book is a bad thing. 
I should be a diary instead. 
With secrets and locks.

Just don’t say anything. 
Don’t think.
Don’t care. 
Don’t be open. 
Shut up and keep to yourself.
