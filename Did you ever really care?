Here we are again..
Same subject.  
Same notebook.
Same blank pages.
And the same damn topic.

When will you ever learn?
Shouldn’t you be stronger by now?
How many pages must you write to rid him from your bones?
Why do your thoughts still wonder towards him?

He never really cared.
And you know that.
You were aiming at an empty target.
Stop thinking about him.
He’s found someone else; someone NEW.

No more mesmerizing stares to take your breath away.
No more butterflies that make you feel as if you could fly.
No more sweet smiles to cast over your bitter days.

The feelings have grown dull
like this dull pencil that was sharp when you started 
You’re hearts fallen back to that deep sleep you’ve grown accustomed to, 
let it rest.
