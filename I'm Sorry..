sometimes I say mean things

sometimes I judge

im not perfect

I can be vicious

and I can be hurtful



but I dont want to be

I always feel bad afterwards

I hope you dont hate me

because of a shallow remark.



Im working on it

I dont want to really hurt anyone

I want to be genuine

I want to be good



I feel bad.

I'm trying.

I'm sorry
