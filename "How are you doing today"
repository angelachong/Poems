I dont know how to answer that
Do you really fucking care how I feel?
Are you asking me sincerely or are you just curious?
Do you really want to get to know me?
Are you asking to make sure I’m surviving?

How do I even begin to answer that?
Do I stay above the surface and remark with a “fine.”
When I’m not really..

My minds racing with indecisive thoughts.
Will you think I’m insane if I told you
that the color gray drives me crazy?
that the world is black and white and I’m stuck in the middle.
that this is where I hate being.
